#1. Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula: Q= Square root of [(2*C*D)/H]
D = 1,4,9,16,25
C, H = 50,30
val = map(lambda x:(2*C*x/H)**1/2,D)
print(list(val))

#2. Define a class named Shape and its subclass Square. The Square class has an init function which takes a length as argument. Both classes have an area function which can print the area of the shape where Shapeâ€™s area is 0 by default.
class Shape:
    length = 0
    def Area(self):
        return (self.length ** 2)

class Square(Shape):
    def __init__(self,length):
        self.length = length

print(Shape().Area())
print(Square(2).Area())

#3. Create a class to find the three elements that sum to zero from a set of n real numbers.

class SumOfThree:
    def Sum0(self, InputList):
        OutputList = []
        for i in range(0,len(InputList)-3):
            for j in range(i+1,len(InputList)):
                for k in range(j+1, len(InputList)):
                    if InputList[i]+InputList[j]+InputList[k] == 0:
                        OutputList.append([InputList[i],InputList[j],InputList[k]])
        return OutputList
InputList = [-25,-10,-7,-3,2,4,8,10]
SumOfThree().Sum0(InputList)

#4. What is the output of the following code? Explain your answer as well.
class A:
    def __init__(self, x=1):
        self.x = x

class der(A):
    def __init__(self, y=2):
        super().__init__()
        self.y = y

def main():
    obj = der()
    print(obj.x, obj.y)


main()

#Ans:  the result will be 1 2. The Class der is inheriting the class A and when we are calling the main function, it is getting the value of x from Class A and y from the child class der.
# Super is calling the function in parent class, it is easy to maintain the code with super, so you can just change the parent class name and you don't have to update the code to call the function, auper will call that.


class A:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.x = x

    def count(self, x):
        self.x = self.x + 1


class B(A):
    def __init__(self, y=0):
        A.__init__(self, 3)
        self.y = y

    def count(self):
        self.y += 1


def main():
    obj = B()
    obj.count()

    print(obj.x, obj.y)


main()

# Ans will be 3 1. Main function is calling class B, which is inheriting class A. In class B y's default value is 0 but in count function it is incrementing by 1, so y will be 1. A.__init__(self, 3) is initializing x with 3. so x will be 3.

class A:
    def __init__(self):
        self.multiply(15)
        print(self.i)

    def multiply(self, i):
        self.i = 4 * i;



class B(A):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

    def multiply(self, i):
        self.i = 2 * i;

obj = B()

#Ans: Above code will print 30.
# Reason: we are creating an object of class B which is a child class of A. using super inside init function of B we are inheriting init of A and getting the value of i as 15. But the multiply function of B is overriding the multiply function of A, hence i = 15*2 = 30.

#5. Create a Time class and initialize it with hours and minutes.
#Make a method addTime which should take two time object and add them. E.g.- (2 hour and 50 min)+(1 hr and 20 min) is (4 hr and 10 min)
#Make a method displayTime which should print the time.
#Make a method DisplayMinute which should display the total minutes in the Time. E.g.- (1 hr 2 min) should display 62 minute.

class Time:
    def __init__(self,timeString):
        self.numbers = [int(i) for i in timeString.split() if i.isdigit()]
        self.hr = self.numbers[0]
        self.min = self.numbers[1]

    def addTime(Time1, Time2):
        hr1 = Time1.hr
        hr2 = Time2.hr
        min1 = Time1.min
        min2 = Time2.min
        TotalMin = ((min1+min2)%60)
        TotalHours = (hr1+hr2)+((min1+min2)//60)
        return Time(str(TotalHours)+" and "+str(TotalMin))

    def displayTime(self):
        print("Sum of both the time is: "+str(self.hr)+" hr and "+str(self.min)+" min")

    def DisplayMinute(self):
        print("Total time in minutes is: "+str(self.hr*60+self.min)+" minutes")

TimeString1 = Time("2 hour and 50 min")
TimeString2 = Time("1 hr and 20 min")
obj2 = Time.addTime(TimeString1, TimeString2)
obj2.displayTime()
obj2.DisplayMinute()

#6. Write a Person class with an instance variable, , and a constructor that takes an integer, , as a parameter. The constructor must assign  to  after confirming the argument passed as  is not negative; if a negative argument is passed as , the constructor should set  to  and print Age is not valid, setting age to 0.. In addition, you must write the following instance methods:
#yearPasses() should increase the  instance variable by .
#amIOld() should perform the following conditional actions:
#If , print You are young..
#If  and , print You are a teenager..
#Otherwise, print You are old

class Person:
   def __init__(self,inputAge):
       self.age = inputAge
       if(self.age<0):
           print("Age is not valid, setting age to 0.")
           self.age = 0
   def amIOld(self):
        if self.age <13:
            print("You are young..")
        elif self.age > 12 and self.age < 20:
            print("You are a teenager")
        else:
            print("You are Old")
   def yearPasses(self):
        self.age += 1

num = int(input("Enter 4: "))

for i in range(0, t):
    age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
    obj = Person(age)
    obj.amIOld()
    for j in range(0, 3):
        obj.yearPasses()
    obj.amIOld()
    print("")
